# python-api-challenge

Hello , This is an excercise authored for Module 6 Challenge 
It is incomplete but mostly substantial .
Code was followed from inclass excercises .
There is instance of numpy use since was receiving error 
about multi dimensional object not supported .
Solution was provided through Stack Overflow .
Overall had enjoyable time putting this together 
also with the help of TA Yash Shah .
Not many hotels were supplied , I think only 2 in the
VacationPY script , and tried variety of selection
criteria for nice weather , but did not have great success
in finding hotels within 10000 meters of city location .
Also function in WeathePy for regression maps did not have
annotate code since integer error was triggered when added 
to function script .
